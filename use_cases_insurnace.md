Thanks to document capture technologies, businesses can rapidly handle large volumes of documents required for claims processing tasks, detect fraudulent claims, and check if claims fit regulations.

### Document creation
Insurance companies need to generate high volumes of documents, including specific information about the insurer. While creating these documents manually consume time and prone to errors, using AI and automation technologies can generate policy statements without mistakes.
